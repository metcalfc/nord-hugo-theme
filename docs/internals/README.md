## Design Philosophy

The Nord Hugo Theme follows these core design principles:

1. **Functional First**: Core functionality works before visual flourishes
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Solid base that works without JavaScript
3. **Responsive by Default**: Mobile-first design approach
4. **Accessible**: Following WCAG guidelines
5. **Themeable**: Clear separation between structure and theme
6. **Performant**: Minimal dependencies and optimized assets
7. **Developer Friendly**: Clear organization and documentation
